# CGM_Project
A project for a course in my varsity's academic year.
Here I have created a project for academic purpose for the course  Computer Graphics and Multimedia. The project I did is named "Transformers". In the project, a giant humanoid robot shrinks its size and transforms into a truck just like the Transformers movies and comics. 

I have used  C++ in CodeBlocks;
Download CodeBlocks from : http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads
I have used freeGlut also;
